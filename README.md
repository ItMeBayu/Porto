  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    I am a 9th semester student majoring in Computer Science at Ganesha University of Education who has completed my thesis. I specialize in intelligent systems and data science. I am interested in data analysis and AI development for solving everyday problems experienced by people. I am actively studying the development of AI and its creation for various purposes and different development methods depending on the development method.

The topic of my thesis is related to the calculation and evaluation of push-up movements using an LSTM model combined with MediaPipe. I also developed a simple simulation using Python as a real-time implementation of the model I built.
